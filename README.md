# The DeskThing ‚úîÔ∏è

*Let's begin, shall we?*

This is the DeskThing project. Using Spotify's existing Car Thing, the DeskThing makes the perfect desk assistant. In short, the DeskThing serves as an alternative OS for the Spotify Car Thing. It allows you to load up community-made apps to it to do anything from control your local audio to seeing who is in your discord call! This is an open source project made by me, Riprod, an independent developer who's not even out of college! If you want to help contribute to this endeavor and attempt to revive the car thing, you can do so through my buymeacoffee link or through Github Sponsors.

Cheers!

*Dammit Jeff posted a video covering the DeskThing! Check it out [here](https://youtu.be/vQVuGeoqyUc?si=80bZQEFqH__qxppf&t=416)*

### Detailed Setup Instructions

Updating this ReadMe with the updated flashing / installation instructions was tedious and led to confusion
