      <h2>‚ñ∂Ô∏è Setting Up</h2>
   </summary>

### Prerequisites

1. **ADB Setup:**
   - Install ADB on your computer (Android Development).

2. **Superbird Webapp flash:**
   - Flash your CarThing with the adb_enabled dump [here](https://mega.nz/folder/NxNXQCaT#-n1zkoXsJuw-5rQ-ZYzRJw/folder/Ak9FVKxJ) using the [superbird-tool](https://github.com/Car-Thing-Hax-Community/superbird-tool).
   - [detailed instructions](#flashing)

### Detailed Setup Instructions

1. **Flash Your CarThing:**
   - Follow the instructions in the [superbird-tool repository](https://github.com/Car-Thing-Hax-Community/superbird-tool) to flash your CarThing device with the necessary image.
> If you need help, refer to the [detailed instructions](#flashing) at the end of this page

2. **Get the installer**
*should be under [releases](https://github.com/ItsRiprod/DeskThing/releases)*

   - Run the 'deskthing-0.5.5-*-setup.*' installer on your computer

3. **Check for your device:**
   - Under the 'Status' tab in v0.5.5 or earlier or 'ADB' tab in v0.5.6 or later, ensure your device shows up. If it does not, join the Discord server and report the issue, this can be buggy on some machines.
> A few things to try if it isn't working is to 1: Use task manager to kill all instances of ADB 2: Run DeskThing as administrator 3: Unplug and plug in your Car thing 4: Install ADB and manually check with `adb devices`
   - If the device shows up, go to the 'Webapps' tab and click the latest version (Only use the ADB version if RNDIS doesn't work)
   - Go back to the 'Devices' tab and click 'Push Staged Webapp' It should take a second, and then your Car Thing should restart.
4. **Load Apps**
   - Congrats! You're basically done. Now go to 'Apps' and then 'Webapps' and download any apps you want. Ensure you check dependencies before doing so as this could cause errors.

      <h2>üì∏Flashing</h2>
   </summary>

Links:
- [image dumps](https://mega.nz/folder/NxNXQCaT#-n1zkoXsJuw-5rQ-ZYzRJw/folder/Ak9FVKxJ)
> Ensure you download one with ADB and RNDIS enabled (any one of the 'new' ones work) 8.4.4_adb_enabled-new.tar.xz is the current best
- [superbird-tool](https://github.com/Car-Thing-Hax-Community/superbird-tool)

Process:
- Go to superbird-tool and install it based off your operating system. Come back once you can run `python superbird_tool.py --find_device` and see your Car Thing
- Unplug the Car Thing
- Hold buttons 1 and 4 (the four large top buttons are mapped from left to right) and plug it in.
- Wait a few seconds. If the screen does not turn on, that means you are in boot mode. You can release the buttons
- Run `python superbird_tool.py --burn_mode` to enter burn mode
> Note: This step may say it fails to enter burn mode. This is okay, continue on as if it worked. There is information in the discord as to why this is.
- Download 8.4.4_adb_enabled-new.tar.xz files from image dumps (linked above) and in that same folder (unzip them)
- (Windows only) Download [zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/) and install the WinUSB driver for **GX-CHIP** (select it and click "Install Driver")
> Alternatively use **libusbK** if it does not work
- Run `superbird_tool.py --restore_device /path/to/extracted/firmware/folder` (This may take a while)
- After the firmware is flashed, the Car Thing should be ready with ADB enabled. To check, run `adb shell ls -l /usr/share/qt-superbird-app/` and you should see webapp as one of the folders.
- Ensure that `adb devices` works and registers `12345 device` as one of the options
- Continue setup from [here](#detailed-setup-instructions)
