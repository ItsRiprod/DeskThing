      <h2>‚ñ∂Ô∏è Setting Up</h2>
   </summary>

### Prerequisites

1. **ADB Setup:**
   - Install ADB on your computer (Android Development).

2. **Superbird Webapp flash:**
   - Flash your CarThing with the adb_enabled dump [here](https://mega.nz/folder/NxNXQCaT#-n1zkoXsJuw-5rQ-ZYzRJw) using the [superbird-tool](https://github.com/bishopdynamics/superbird-tool).
   - [detailed instructions](#flashing)

### Detailed Setup Instructions

1. **Flash Your CarThing:**
   - Follow the instructions in the [superbird-tool repository](https://github.com/bishopdynamics/superbird-tool) to flash your CarThing device with the necessary image.
> If you need help, refer to the [detailed instructions](#flashing) at the end of this page

2. **Get the built webapp under installation files:**
*should be under Releases*

   - Unzip the file 'deskthing-client-build-v0.-.-.zip' onto your computer
   - open a command prompt in that directory for step 3

3. **Pushing the project to the car thing:**
   - Open port 8891:
     ```sh
     adb reverse tcp:8891 tcp:8891
     ```
     > adb should be an environment variable from step 1
   - Remount the build to the carthing:
     ```sh
      adb shell mount -o remount,rw /
      adb shell mv /usr/share/qt-superbird-app/webapp /tmp/webapp-orig
      adb shell mv /tmp/webapp-orig /usr/share/qt-superbird-app/ # it's ok if this fails
      adb shell rm -r /tmp/webapp-orig
      adb push dist/ /usr/share/qt-superbird-app/webapp # Ensure dist/ is in the directory you are running this from
     ```
   - Restart chromium:
     ```sh
     adb shell supervisorctl restart chromium
     ```

4. **Setting up the server:**

   - Download the correct installer under the files for your operating system
   - Download any .zip apps that you want that match the version of the installer
   - Run the installer
   - Drag-n-drop the apps you want one at a time (keeping in mind some have dependencies on other apps)
   - Ensure that the top left wifi icon is green (connected to car thing)
   - Ensure you get the

Links:
- [image dumps](https://mega.nz/folder/NxNXQCaT#-n1zkoXsJuw-5rQ-ZYzRJw/folder/5kECGT5C)
- [superbird-tool](https://github.com/bishopdynamics/superbird-tool)

Process:
- Go to superbird-tool and install it based off your operating system. Come back once you can run `python superbird_tool.py --find_device` and see your Car Thing
- Unplug the Car Thing
- Hold buttons 1 and 4 (the four large top buttons are mapped from left to right) and plug it in.
- Wait a few seconds. If the screen does not turn on, that means you are in boot mode. You can realease the buttons
- Run `python superbird_tool.py --burn_mode` to enter burn mode
- Download 8.2.5 adb enables from image dumps (linked above) and in that same folder, also download Readme.txt
- Follow the Readme.txt to change the appropriate file names
- (Windows only) Download [zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/) and install the WinUSB driver for GX-CHIP (select it and click "Install Driver")
> Alternatively use libusbK if it does not work
- Run `superbird_tool.py --restore_device /path/to/extracted/firmware/folder` (This may take awhile)
- After the firmware is flashed, the Car Thing should be ready with ADB enabled. To check, run `adb shell ls -l /usr/share/qt-superbird-app/` and you should see webapp as one of the folders.
- Continue setup from [here](#detailed-setup-instructions)
