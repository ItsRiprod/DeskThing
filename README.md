# The DeskThing ‚úîÔ∏è
> *Just another CarThing app built off the back of superbird üéµ*

*Let's begin, shall we?*

This is the DeskThing project. Using Spotify's existing Car Thing, the DeskThing make's the perfect desk assistant. Integrating Trello API, Spotify API, AccuWeather API, and Macro capabilities, the DeskThing shoots to be *the* thing for controlling your desk environment. 
> ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è POTENTIALLY OUTDATED ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è There were recent changes made to make it more modular! Now, modify `app_config.json` under /server/ to add/remove which apps you want to include! Only set up the apps that you need and the rest will be handled by the program

> Setup is quite intense, so be prepared!

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏èHow It Does It

### Prerequisites

1. **ADB Setup:**
   - Install ADB on your computer (Android Development).

2. **Superbird Webapp flash:**
   - Flash your CarThing with the adb_enabled dump [here](https://mega.nz/folder/NxNXQCaT#-n1zkoXsJuw-5rQ-ZYzRJw) using the [superbird-tool](https://github.com/bishopdynamics/superbird-tool).
   - [detailed instructions](#flashing)

### Detailed Setup Instructions

1. **Flash Your CarThing:**
   - Follow the instructions in the [superbird-tool repository](https://github.com/bishopdynamics/superbird-tool) to flash your CarThing device with the necessary image.
> If you need help, refer to the [detailed instructions](#flashing) at the end of this page

2. **Configure Apps You Want To Include:**
   - Spotify app [installation instructions here](/server/apps/spotify#spotify-app-install)
   - Trello app [installation instructions here](/server/apps/trello#trello-app-install)
   - Weather app [installation instructions here](/server/apps/weather#weather-app-install)
   - Launchpad app [installation instructions here](/server/apps/launchpad#launchpad-app-install)
   - Discord app [installation instructions here](/server/apps/discord#discord-app-install)
   - Audible app [installation instructions here](/server/apps/audible#audible-app-install)

3. **Configure Workspace:**
   - Use `cd ./DeskThing` to get into the project directory and run:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
   - Add `.env` file to `/DeskThing/server/` (optionally, just rename `.env-template` to `.env`. `.env-template` is already located where it needs to be)
   - Ensure `PORT=8888` in the `.env` file
> If anything here does not work. DM me on discord @riprod

4. **Pushing the project to the car thing:**
   - Build project:
     ```sh
     npm run build
     ```
   - Open port 8891:
     ```sh
     adb reverse tcp:8891 tcp:8891
     ```
     > adb should be an environment variable from step 1
   - Remount the build to the carthing:
     ```sh
      adb shell mount -o remount,rw /
      adb shell mv /usr/share/qt-superbird-app/webapp /tmp/webapp-orig
      adb shell mv /tmp/webapp-orig /usr/share/qt-superbird-app/ # it's ok if this fails
      adb shell rm -r /tmp/webapp-orig
      adb push dist/ /usr/share/qt-superbird-app/webapp
     ```
   - Restart chromium:
     ```sh
     adb shell supervisorctl restart chromium
     ```
   - Start your server:
     ```sh
     start cmd.exe /k "node server/server.js"
     ```

## üì∏Flashing

Links:
- [image dumps](https://mega.nz/folder/NxNXQCaT#-n1zkoXsJuw-5rQ-ZYzRJw/folder/5kECGT5C)
- [superbird-tool](https://github.com/bishopdynamics/superbird-tool)

Process:
- Go to superbird-tool and install it based off your operating system. Come back once you can run `python superbird_tool.py --find_device` and see your Car Thing
- Unplug the Car Thing
- Hold buttons 1 and 4 (the four large top buttons are mapped from left to right) and plug it in.
- Wait a few seconds. If the screen does not turn on, that means you are in boot mode. You can realease the buttons
- Run `python superbird_tool.py --burn_mode` to enter burn mode
- Download 8.2.5 adb enables from image dumps (linked above) and in that same folder, also download Readme.txt
- Follow the Readme.txt to change the appropriate file names
- (Windows only) Download [zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/) and install the WinUSB driver for GX-CHIP (select it and click "Install Driver")
> Alternatively use libusbK if it does not work
- Run `superbird_tool.py --restore_device /path/to/extracted/firmware/folder` (This may take awhile)
- After the firmware is flashed, the Car Thing should be ready with ADB enabled. To check, run `adb shell ls -l /usr/share/qt-superbird-app/` and you should see webapp as one of the folders.
- Continue setup from [here](#detailed-setup-instructions)

## ü§ñ Linux Mods

Currently, DeskThing does not have great support for linux. This will be resolved once DeskThing becomes modular, but for now you can do the following steps:
- Follow superbird-tool tutorial for flashing the car thing with the ADB_ENABLES flash
- Ensure ADB is installed correctly
- run `npm uninstall midi robotsjs`
- in `/server/socketHandler.js` remove any mention of robotsjs
- in `/server/server.js` remove the import statement for the launchpadHandler.js
> I don't run linux - so if there are any more incompatibilites, DM me on discord @riprod so I can add them here
- Run the following script (After obtaining env files):
```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Change directory to the car thing files location
cd "/path/to/carthing/DeskThing/"

# Set environment variables
export SPOTIFY_API_ID= # The API key from a Spotify app obtained from the dashboard
export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET= # The Spotify client secret obtained from the dashboard  
export SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8888/callback # This is for authenticating yourself
export PORT=8888 # Port that is used for authentication
export DEVICE_ID= # ID of your device found in the Spotify REST API - optional to know where you are playing music from

export TRELLO_TOKEN= # Trello bot token
export TRELLO_KEY= # Trello bot key
export TRELLO_SECRET= # Trello bot secret
export ACCUWEATHER_API_KEY= # Key obtained from AccuWeather app
export ACCUWEATHER_CITY= # City key obtained from AccuWeather app

export DISCORD_CLIENT_ID= # Discord bot id
export DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET= # Discord bot secret
export DISCORD_REDIR_URI=http://localhost:8888/discord/callback
export DISCORD_USER_ID= # Your user ID

# Use adb to reverse ports and move files
adb reverse tcp:8891 tcp:8891
adb shell mount -o remount,rw /
adb shell mv /usr/share/qt-superbird-app/webapp /tmp/webapp-orig
adb shell mv /tmp/webapp-orig /usr/share/qt-superbird-app/ # it's ok if this fails
adb shell rm -r /tmp/webapp-orig
adb push dist/ /usr/share/qt-superbird-app/webapp
adb shell supervisorctl restart chromium

# Start the server
node server/server.js
```

### Discord Flatpak work around

If you are encountering an error `reject(new Error('Could not connect'));` then try the following found [here](https://github.com/flathub/com.discordapp.Discord/wiki/Rich-Precense-(discord-rpc))

Run the following:
```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/user-tmpfiles.d
echo 'L %t/discord-ipc-0 - - - - app/com.discordapp.Discord/discord-ipc-0' > ~/.config/user-tmpfiles.d/discord-rpc.conf
systemctl --user enable --now systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service
```
