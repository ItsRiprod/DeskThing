# carthing
 This is THE repo where I will be building my carthing app with Vite

## *Built off the backs of giants*

This is the CarThing TODOThing project. Integration with Trello while still being able to control your spotify music.

Setup on this is so intense that I would recommend doing literally anything else before attempting...


Whats this?

Still interesting??


Well first you need to set up adb on your computer (Android Development) and flash your carthing with the webapp 

Then you need to build the react projects under... i shpose you'll have to find it if you get here before i reorganize things

Then finally you'll have to find your spotify authentication key (should be prompted when you launch) along with your trello powerup (good luck) and then, and only then, will you be able to use both trello and spotify. 

Open port 8891 `adb reverse tcp:8891 tcp:8891` in order to establish communication between the car thing and your server `node server/server.js`




It's 4:04 in the morning right now. I *will* update this later ~~optional~~
